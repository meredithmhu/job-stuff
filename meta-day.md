# What does Meta Do?
help people make meaningful connections 
founded by mark zuckerberg "way back when" 
they work really hard to connect people 

suite of apps: facebook, messenger, instagram, whatsapp, threads 
- some people use facebook marketplace. Billions of dollars of revenue are generated through that every day

threads is the fastest growing app in 2023 

they have meta raybans and meta quest ! 

they are focused on the metaverse! 
- AI, wearables, research

3 billion people around the world use Meta, holy crap!! 


# AI at Meta 
Meta AI built with Llama 3.1 
Building AI "responsibly" and "ethically" 


# Meta's Culture
Cultural values across all offices.
1. Move fast (not break stuff anymore) - focused on learning faster than anyone else
2. meta, Metamates, and me - no one person is greater than our goal

Allocate work based on strengths. It's very performance driven at Meta. You should come here to do the best work of your career 
Meta Resource Groups - underrepresented groups 

# React Talk 
Batya Zamansky - software engineer
React - a javascript library for building user interfaces 
She's a great speaker, wow
First publicly introduced by Tom Occhino 
React returns HTML that renders into UI 
Change the data, rerender the UI instead of changing the UI. Is this performant? It only changes the changed parts through an AST.

React Virtual DOM - is a tree 
React Tree. Stores least possible amount of data. 
- sibling pointer
- parent pointer
- child pointer
- these three pointers are the minimum amount of data you need to store
- tearing - there's a difference in the tree when it deviates, so the tree records every difference in UI that occurs 

Work loop 
- render phase ???
- this was really cool, but she went too fast

how do you use react/ how does it work?
- the markup syntax we saw in the previous slides is called JSX - most React projects use it for convenience because it's easier to read. you have to close tags always and only returning one tag
  - so sometimes, it's wrapped in a tag that's empty
  - react doesn't care how you add CSS into it
  - you can "escape into Java Script", whatever that means
  - there's conditionals (ternary operator), lists, and responding to event. event handler functions inside components
  - what happens when you wanna remember info and display it? you should use state.

state variables:
- `[count, setCount] = useState(0)`
- count is the state and setCount is the function that lets you increment the state
- using hooks. functions starting with use are called Hooks and useState is a built-in hook that React has
- what happens when the components share data? lift the state to a wrapper component - that way all the children can share one state variable.

takeaways: 
- it's a JS library and it builds UIs 
- you can build interactive components in web using react
- uses the virtual

## What sparked your interest, and what was your recruiting process
- meta is very generalist
- meta works in so many areas, so it's a great startingg place
- they give you lots of freedom and autonomy doing stuff
- meta has a huge scale of work. learn how to scale your code - make sure it can serve millions or billions of people. meta is the BIGGEST!!
- people love working there as well

## meta is innovating - how does AI touch the job 
- you can ask meta AI stuff on instagram in various ways
- AI code suggestion tools are available at Facebook
- AI meme generator
- AI searching of the company data
- AI is really baked into the culture at Meta, it's everywhere. everyone writes performance reviews at the last second and they use meta-chatgpt for it lmaoooo 

## how does meta balance the need for innovation with protecting the security of user's data 
- checks and balances for accessing user data: some sensitive data is locked behind special permissions
- they are super focused on privacy
- what is a DIFF? a diff is when you push code to production, difference in commit. It's a PR.

## how does meta commit to DEI in the engineer teams?
- there's focus on community, finding a support system
- they encourage you to join different groups in the company, they have networking opportunities, mentorship, social events, women in tech events, women leadership program
- peer mentorship program. every level requires mentorship. also everyone at meta is smart, and willing to share their stories
- many opportunities to grow
- lots of internal mobility - if you wanna change teams, you can do that.
- you can design your own trajectory
- meta fosters a huge growth culture - they want you to grow as an engineer

## how do you prepare for interviews/ tips on preparing for interviews? 
- connect with them as humans, because your technical skill won't make you stand out
- interviewers are looking for specific signals - you must cater to the role in specific. you should ask what what the interviewer is looking for and speak to that
- don't try to fake it if you don't know something
- do some self-reflection and specialize and focus on a few things. don't try to spread yourself too thin
- try to let your strengths shine through. at meta you have tons of autonomy, so you'll get decision paralysis if you don't know who you are, what you like working on
- communication!! focus on trying to be able to communicate your thoughts
- it's okay if you need a hint or two from the interview!
- TALK during your interview, man. "The goodwill you can ingratiate through your interview"

Too new to evaluate? You aren't evaluated if you join at a weird time.
