- address unmet needs in our communities
- huge part of the culture
- 5 key areas: public health, education, environment, arts and culture, government innovation

- diversity and inclusion
- empathetic workplace
- diversity and inclusion communities

# our offices 
- the new york city main hub in manhattan
- fish food and flowers are at all the offices, having a beautiful office
- new jersey office - princeton office

# software engineering opportunities 
- 2025 internship
- events in NYC and orinceton
- also a first year engineering summer internship
- you can also be a 2025 full time software engineer. 7 weeks of training, job fair, build a bloomberg network, and get a dedicated mentor to navigate your early career.

# interview process
- first round interview: 1 hour virtual technical
- next is a virtual interview or on campus interview. they come to you for this
- then it's a behavioral interview
- senior engineering manager interview: i hour high level technical discussion with a systems design question
- perform at the best of your ability

# what is evaluated
- your problem solving abilities (a lot of algo will be on the test)
- they're trying to evaluated your abnility to use code to solve problems
- how you react to being collaborative
- leverage what you learned at cornell 
- understanding of CS fundamentals
- drive and willingness to learn

# what's included in a tech interview
- resume walk through (general technical capability) and they're gonna ask about this if it's interesting 
- hands on coding - they're gonna go to a whiteboard or hackerrank. the code doesn't need to run per se. you're gonna be writing hundreds of lines in these interviews 
- questions about DSA ?
- last 15 minutes are reserved for you, to ask questions to the interviewer

# resume
- the career center helps a lot
- 5 minute pitch to introduce yourself
- definitely make sure the resume is easily skimmable and readable
- make a GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION!~!!
- content is impactful, be thoughtful with the words

# data structures and algorithms 
- 2110 and 2112 know EVERYTHING in that class. knowledge of common data strictures and possible implementations, runtime for operations, pros and cons, they ask you to implement one, know a variety inside and out, arrays linked lists binary trees tries hashmap etc.
- algorithms: searching sorting traversing are common, focus on strengths and weaknesses
- no one asks ford fulkerson. if they ask then it's to see how you derive algorithms
- common problem solving techniques like starting from a back of an array, using two pointers to traverse a structure, recognizing first in, first out operations, combining multiple data structures. leverage common patterns and that can get you out of binds.

# do your research...
- understand what the company does
- have questions prepared
- use your interview as a chance to learn more, the interviewer is trying to sell the company. it is NOT good if you don't have questions! you should be really excited to work at a company, ask the engineer about what they do, build rapport with the interviewer. you ened to use the time to make a good choice about where you wanna work.

# practice!!
- work through problems on paper or a whiteboard
- practice with friends
- try to replicate the interview experience
- talk out loud
- leetcode
- so - sit and grind leetcode, but also do practice interviews. have them see your resume. it's good to get those jitters out. people are doing in person interviews for the first time ever

# take care of yourself
- go to bed early the night before
- don't forget to eat and drink plenty of water
- everyone gets nervous!!
- bloomberg wants to make it as friendly for you as possible
- maybe you have 4 interviews in a day or something

# how to approach a technical problem
- make sure you're practicing, make sure you study
- listen to the problem and ask clarifying questions. like get an idea of what is going on. restate the problem. then start the solution that comes to mind, begin working towards a complete design. it's okay to start with an inefficient solution, you don't have to get the perfect answer - in fact that's less impressive because it means you've seen it before. it's good for the interviewer to know that you can look at a question and know there's a solution and that you have an idea of the approximate runtime of it.
- you should have sort of a conversation with the interviewer. if this person was on my team and if we had a super hard question then if we had to figure it out then what would that look like? i'm seeing you live code i'm not looking for a perfect solution. we're looking for collaboration that's solid
- you'll ALWAYS be asked what is the runtime complexity and space complexity of the solution?
- the questions leak... they have extensions to the question. they need.. they NEED to see what happens when you see something you haven't seen before.

# remember it's interactive!
- reflect
- clarify assumptions
- ability to communicate is very very important

# sample question
Given an array of unique positive integers and a target value, print all pairs whose sum is equal to the target (Twosum)

There are a lot of possible extensions that can happen to this question to make it harder.

Networking. Please ask questions.
